## Me 👱🏻

My name is _Angelo Thys_, the writer of this blog.
Passionate about development, system administration and cybersecurity.
Studying to become a self thought software engineer.

## My areas of interest 📚

What I write about varies a lot, and is motivated by my own learning
and understanding of topics.

However, my topics of interest
can be agglomerated under the following umbrellas ☂️:

- [x] Algorithms and Data Structures (Possibly some leetcode 🤖)
- [x] Frontend development (React ⚛️, Astro 🚀 and vanilla 🍦)
- [x] Backend development (Python 🐉, Go 🦫 and Node.js 🟢)
- [x] Cybersecurity (Possibly some writeups 📝)
- [x] System Administration (services⚙️, networking 🌐 and docker 🐳)

## The blog 📝

The blog is made with [Astro](https://astro.build/) 🚀
and templated with [Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)
